In this project, we will teach Pac-Man to search his world to complete the following tasks:

- find a single obstacle.
- find multiple obstacles.
- find the fastest way to eat all the food in the map.

This project is possible thanks to the generous contributions of the UC Berkeley AI division and their work on the [Pac-Man Project](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/project_overview.html).
