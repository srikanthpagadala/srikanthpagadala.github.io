Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree teaches you how to become a machine learning engineer, and apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more.

Program is divided into 6 parts.

- Data Exploration
- Model Evaluation and Validation
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Machine Learning Specializations

Each part ends with a project that you have to complete in order to graduate. Following are my project submissions.
