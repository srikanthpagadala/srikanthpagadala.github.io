XGBoost can be used to create some of the most performant models for tabular data using the gradient boosting algorithm.

Once trained, it is often a good practice to save your model to file for later use in making predictions new test and validation datasets and entirely new data.

Here you will discover how to save your XGBoost models to file using the standard Python pickle API.
