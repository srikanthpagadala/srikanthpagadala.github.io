Finding Lane Lines in a video clip is considered the "Hello World" of **Computer Vision** in **Robotics**.

It involves following steps:

- Color Selection
- Region Masking
- Canny Edge Detection
- Hough Tranform

[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)  is our choice of tool in Python for computer vision. It provides implementation of all of the above algorithms.

This mini-project takes you step-by-step through the Lane Lines detection. Towards the end it also shows scenarios where such simple implementation will fail.
