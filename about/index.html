    	Friends call me Shrek. There is an interesting story behind how I got this nickname - which, btw, is better 
    	told over a beer! Although, I love animated films genre, I swear I'm neither Green nor Oger-ish. 
    	This is me and my little world.

    	I grew up all over in India. Dad was an officer in Indian Army. So my brother and I got an amazing childhood of traveling, 
    	exploring and experiencing variety of India. I can speak 5 Indian languages and cook variety of cuisines. Army schools have 
    	instilled Discipline, Leadership and Team Spirit in me. A Dutch company hired me straight out of the college, so I got to work 
    	and explore Europe for few years. I immigrated to United States in 2001. Fell in Love with the innovative pace of Silicon Valley 
    	so much that I became of here :)
