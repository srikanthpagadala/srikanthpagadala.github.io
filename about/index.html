    	My fun name is Shrek. Friends call me Shrek. It is an interesting story how I got this nickname - which, btw, is better 
    	told over a beer! Although, I love animated films genre, I swear that I'm neither Green nor Oger-ish. In fact, this is me and 
    	my little world.

    	I grew up all over in India. Dad was an officer in Indian Army. So we got an amazing childhood of traveling, exploring 
    	and blending with varied cultures of India. Army schools have instilled Discipline, Leadership and Team Spirit in me. 
    	A Dutch company hired me straight out of the college. So I got to work and explore Europe for few years. I immigrated to
    	United States in 2001. Loved the innovative pace of Silicon Valley so much that I became off here :)
