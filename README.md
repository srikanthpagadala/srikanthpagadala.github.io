I'm an AI Engineer in San Francisco Bay Area. Some of my areas of work are

- Machine Learning

- Artificial Neural Networks
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision

I'm currently working towards becoming Self-Driving Car Engineer. Other area of my interest is Genetics, Genome Sequencing and Genetics Engineering. It is my escape into a new world, away from my daily work life.

This is my online [world](https://srikanthpagadala.github.io/). Every day I discover new things in AI, NN, CV and Robotics. I'm of the type who learns by doing things. This website is my collection of mini-projects as I try my hands on new techniques and frameworks. 

I hope you will find them useful as you embark on the same journey.

I've taken up Consulting opportunities with various companies in Bay Area since 2010.
