<h3>Professional Summary</h3>

14 years of software development and architecture experience.  I’m super excited about all the recent changes that 
are happening in the areas of AI, ML, RL, NN, CV, NLP, and Robotics. I’ve decided to make a career change and be 
part of all of it. In my recent careers, I did lot of work in Big Data Analytics, IoT, Cloud Computing with Java 
and Spring.
